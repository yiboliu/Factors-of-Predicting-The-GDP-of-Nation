# Factors-of-Predicting-The-GDP-of-Nation
This project uses different factors to predict the GDP per capita of a nation.
We collect data of various areas of the world in year 1992. 
We created the full model using all the factors possible to predict the GDP per capita across the world. 
Then using the backward elimination, we get the sub model which is most efficient one, considering the issue of precision.
Next, we divide the nations to groups according to geography properties. 
For each group, we use the same strategy to get the most proper model. 
For outliers in each group, we researched and proposed different factors that weren't present in the data file.
For example, in the Europe group, Swissland has a significantly higher GDP per capita than other nations, and we proposed that the highly developed banking industry contributes to that. In the South America group, we proposed the corrupt index as the possible reason that Bolivia has a unusual data GDP per capita, considering the factors included in the data file we studied.
